    "text": "The Challenge: Where Should We Farm the Ocean?\nAs global demand for seafood continues to rise, aquaculture—the farming of aquatic organisms—has emerged as a critical solution to meet nutritional needs while reducing pressure on wild fish stocks. But not all ocean waters are created equal. Marine species have specific environmental requirements, and identifying optimal farming locations requires careful spatial analysis of oceanographic conditions.\nThis analysis addresses a key question: Which U.S. West Coast Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) offers the most suitable habitat for commercially important shellfish species?\nBy combining sea surface temperature data, ocean depth measurements, and exclusive economic zone boundaries (EEZ), we can pinpoint the regions where aquaculture operations would have the greatest chance of success."

    "text": "Why This Matters\nAquaculture is the fastest-growing food production sector globally, now accounting for over half of all fish consumed worldwide (FAO, 2022). Along the U.S. West Coast, shellfish farming represents a sustainable industry that provides economic benefits to coastal communities while offering ecosystem services like water filtration and habitat creation.\nHowever, the success of aquaculture operations depends heavily on site selection. Species like oysters and abalone have narrow tolerance ranges for temperature and depth. Farming outside these optimal conditions leads to increased mortality, slower growth rates, and economic losses. Climate change further complicates this picture, as shifting ocean temperatures may alter which regions remain viable for specific species (Froehlich et al., 2018).\nUnderstanding current habitat suitability is therefore essential for:\n\nIndustry planning: Guiding investment decisions for aquaculture operations\nRegulatory management: Informing marine spatial planning within EEZs\nClimate adaptation: Establishing baselines to track future habitat shifts"

    "section": "The Approach: Habitat Suitability Modeling",
    "text": "The Approach: Habitat Suitability Modeling\nThe analysis follows a systematic workflow that identifies suitable aquaculture locations. Let’s break it down step by step using the Rock scallop (Crassedoma giganteum) as an example. The Rock scallop prefers temperate water temperatures of about 13–22°C and shallower waters down to 45 meters.\n\nDefine species requirements: Set suitable sea surface temperature (°C) and depth ranges (m). Then identify the input layers (SST rasters, depth rasters, EEZ polygons). This anchors all further processing to the species’ physiological needs.\n\n\n\nShow code\nspecies_name &lt;- \"Rock scallop\"\nsst_min &lt;- 13; sst_max &lt;- 22      # acceptable SST in °C\ndepth_min &lt;- -45; depth_max &lt;- 0 # acceptable depth in m\nsst_data &lt;- mean_sst               # sea surface temperature raster\ndepth_data &lt;- depth_resampled      # depth raster\neez_data &lt;- eez                    # EEZ polygons\n\n\n\nReclassify environmental layers: Use reclassification matrices to convert continuous SST and depth into binary masks: values inside the acceptable range get a 1 (suitable) and everything else a 0 (unsuitable). For SST, the matrix maps anything below sst_min or above sst_max to 0, and values between to 1; for depth, the matrix does the same with depth_min and depth_max. Calling classify() with these matrices produces yes/no suitability rasters.\n\n\n\nShow code\nsst_rcl &lt;- matrix(c(-Inf, sst_min, 0,\n                    sst_min, sst_max, 1,\n                    sst_max, Inf, 0),\n                  ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)\ndepth_rcl &lt;- matrix(c(-Inf, depth_min, 0,\n                      depth_min, depth_max, 1,\n                      depth_max, Inf, 0),\n                    ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)\n\nsst_bin   &lt;- classify(sst_data, rcl = sst_rcl)\ndepth_bin &lt;- classify(depth_data, rcl = depth_rcl)\ndepth_stack &lt;- rep(depth_bin, nlyr(sst_bin))  # match layers\n\n\n\nOverlay analysis: Combine the SST and depth masks to keep only cells that satisfy both criteria. The product of the two binary layers identifies candidate habitat cells.\n\n\n\nShow code\nsuitable_cells &lt;- lapp(c(sst_bin, depth_stack),\n                       fun = function(sst, depth) sst * depth)\n\n\n\nZonal statistics: Quantify suitable area by EEZ. Align projections, mask suitability to EEZ boundaries, convert EEZ polygons to a raster of IDs, multiply suitability by cell area (km²), and sum within each zone. This produces a ranked table of suitable area per EEZ, turning raster cells of suitability into regional metrics that we can visualize.\n\n\n\nShow code\neez_data &lt;- st_transform(eez_data, crs(suitable_cells))\nsuitable_masked &lt;- mask(suitable_cells, vect(eez_data))\neez_rast &lt;- rasterize(vect(eez_data), suitable_masked[[1]], field = \"rgn\")\ncell_area &lt;- cellSize(suitable_masked, unit = \"km\")\nsuitable_area_rast &lt;- suitable_masked * cell_area\ntotal_area_per_eez &lt;- zonal(suitable_area_rast, eez_rast, fun = \"sum\", na.rm = TRUE)\ncolnames(total_area_per_eez) &lt;- c(\"Region\", \"Suitable Area (km2)\")\nranked_eez &lt;- total_area_per_eez[order(-total_area_per_eez$\"Suitable Area (km2)\"), ]\n\n\n\nVisualization: Join the computed suitable area back to the EEZ polygons and map the results.

They thrive in waters with temperatures between 11–30°C and depths from the surface down to 70 meters.\n\n\nShow code\nmap_species_suitability(\"Oysters\", sst_min = 11, sst_max = 30, \n                        depth_min = -70, depth_max = 0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Habitat suitability for oyster aquaculture across West Coast EEZs. Central California emerges as the region with the greatest suitable area.\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Finding: Central California offers the most extensive suitable habitat for general oyster farming, with its combination of moderate temperatures and extensive shallow coastal waters.\n\n\n\nCase Study 2: Olympia Oysters (Ostrea lurida)\nThe Olympia oyster is the only oyster species native to the West Coast and has significant ecological and cultural value. However, it has much narrower temperature requirements (10–12°C) compared to other oyster species but similar depths (down to 71 meters).\n\n\nShow code\nmap_species_suitability(\"Olympia Oysters\", sst_min = 10, sst_max = 12, \n                        depth_min = -71, depth_max = 0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Habitat suitability for Olympia oyster aquaculture. Washington’s cooler waters provide the most suitable conditions for this native species.\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Finding: Washington emerges as the optimal region for Olympia oyster restoration and aquaculture efforts, reflecting the species’ preference for cooler northern waters.\n\n\n\nCase Study 3: Red Abalone (Haliotis rufescens)\nRed abalone are prized for their meat and shells but have experienced dramatic population declines due to overharvesting and disease. They prefer temperatures between 8–18°C and shallower depths (down to 24 meters).\n\n\nShow code\nmap_species_suitability(\"Red Abalone\", sst_min = 8, sst_max = 18, \n                        depth_min = -24, depth_max = 0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Habitat suitability for red abalone aquaculture.

Casting to a float ensures safe color scaling. We stretch the colormap (vmin=8200, vmax=13500) to brighten the scene to more clearly show burn scars, but the scars still show up as subtle dark patches against the surrounding vegetation.\n\n\nCode\n# Build and clean RGB\nrgb = landsat[[\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"]].to_array()\nrgb = rgb.where(np.isfinite(rgb), 0).astype(float)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 8))\n_ = rgb.plot.imshow(\n    ax=ax,\n    vmin=8200, vmax=13500,\n    robust=True,\n    add_colorbar=False\n)\n\n# Overlays\npalisades.boundary.plot(ax=ax, color=\"red\", linewidth=1)\neaton.boundary.plot(ax=ax, color=\"red\", linewidth=1)\n\n# Labels\np_center = palisades.geometry.centroid.iloc[0]\ne_center = eaton.geometry.centroid.iloc[0]\ndx, dy = 100, -5000\nax.text(p_center.x + dx, p_center.y + dy, \"Palisades Fire\",\n        color=\"black\", fontsize=10, ha=\"left\", va=\"center\",\n        bbox=dict(facecolor=\"white\", edgecolor=\"black\", boxstyle=\"round,pad=0.2\", alpha=0.8))\nax.text(e_center.x + dx, e_center.y + dy, \"Eaton Fire\",\n        color=\"black\", fontsize=10, ha=\"left\", va=\"center\",\n        bbox=dict(facecolor=\"white\", edgecolor=\"black\", boxstyle=\"round,pad=0.2\", alpha=0.8))\n\n# Lock view to the raster extent \nax.set_xlim(float(rgb.x.min()), float(rgb.x.max()))\nax.set_ylim(float(rgb.y.min()), float(rgb.y.max()))\n\nax.set_title(\"Landsat True Color (Palisades/Eaton)\", fontsize=12, fontweight=\"bold\")\nax.set_axis_off()\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFalse-Color Burn Severity Map\nIn contrast to the true-color map, a false-color rendering remaps bands to emphasize burn severity: we display SWIR (sensitive to char/ash and soil moisture) as red, NIR (healthy vegetation) as green, and red as blue. This makes burned areas stand out more clearly. We then reproject the fire perimeters to the Landsat CRS, overlay them in red, and label each fire so the false-color composite directly highlights where and how severely the Palisades and Eaton fires affected the landscape.\n\n\nCode\n# Build false-color stack (SWIR–NIR–Red)\nfci = landsat[[\"swir22\", \"nir08\", \"red\"]].to_array()\nfci = fci.where(np.isfinite(fci), 0).astype(float)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 8))\n_ = fci.plot.imshow(\n    ax=ax,\n    vmin=7000,\n    vmax=15000,\n    robust=True,\n    add_colorbar=False\n)\n\n# Overlays\npalisades.boundary.plot(ax=ax, color=\"red\", linewidth=1)\neaton.boundary.plot(ax=ax, color=\"red\", linewidth=1)\n\n# Labels\np_center = palisades.geometry.centroid.iloc[0]\ne_center = eaton.geometry.centroid.iloc[0]\ndx, dy = 100, -5000\nax.text(p_center.x + dx, p_center.y + dy, \"Palisades Fire\",\n        color=\"black\", fontsize=10, ha=\"left\", va=\"center\",\n        bbox=dict(facecolor=\"white\", edgecolor=\"black\", boxstyle=\"round,pad=0.2\", alpha=0.8))\nax.text(e_center.x + dx, e_center.y + dy, \"Eaton Fire\",\n        color=\"black\", fontsize=10, ha=\"left\", va=\"center\",\n        bbox=dict(facecolor=\"white\", edgecolor=\"black\", boxstyle=\"round,pad=0.2\", alpha=0.8))\n\n# Lock view to raster extent\nax.set_xlim(float(fci.x.min()), float(fci.x.max()))\nax.set_ylim(float(fci.y.min()), float(fci.y.max()))\n\nax.set_title(\"Landsat False Color (Palisades/Eaton)\", fontsize=12, fontweight=\"bold\")\nax.set_axis_off()\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSWIR–NIR–red composites render burned areas in red hues and healthy vegetation in greens, so the perimeter overlays become immediately interpretable."

It comes from the FIRIS (Fire Integrated Real-time Intelligence System) infrared aicraft system in collaboration with the NIFC (National Interagency Fire Center. The data was accessed 2025-12-22 from ArcGIS Online. For this analysis we use just the .shp file in the folder.\n2) Landsat 8 Collection 2 Level-2 surface reflectance\nThe second dataset is a NetCDF containing multispectral surface reflectance information from (RGB, NIR, SWIR) from the Landsat 8 satellite. This data was downloaded from Microsoft Planetary Computer on 2025-11-22, and is read as an xarrayDataset.\nWe use five bands in our analysis:\n\nRed/Green/Blue (Bands 4/3/2): true-color composites.\nNear-Infrared (NIR08 - Band 5): vegetation response.\nShort-Wave Infrared (SWIR22 Bands 6/7): moisture/char sensitivity, used to highlight burn scars via false-color composites.\n\n3) Environmental Justice Index (EJI)\nThe final dataset we use is the census tract-level poverty indicator sourced from the 2018–2022 Census Bureau American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year data and downloaded from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. We use the “E_POV200” variable defined in the metadata as “Percentage of persons with income below 200% of the federal poverty level” to map socioeconomic vulnerability in tracts intersecting the fire perimeters."

The goal of this map is too compare the census tracts within each fire boundary and determine if there is economic injustice within either area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, neither footprint is dominated by very high‑poverty tracts, but there’s a clear contrast: the Eaton perimeter includes a few tracts with markedly higher poverty shares (darker blues), while the Palisades tracts are mostly midrange to lower. This mirrors Los Angeles’ spatial pattern—more affluent coastal/Westside areas around Palisades versus pockets of higher economic vulnerability farther east—suggesting greater potential EJ concerns within parts of the Eaton area."

    "text": "{#cr-intro} When I began the Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program at UC Santa Barbara’s Bren School, I knew I was stepping into a world where environmental science meets cutting-edge computational methods. What I didn’t fully anticipate was how profoundly this one-year intensive program would reshape my understanding of data, science, and the complex environmental challenges facing our planet.\nThis journey—from foundational mathematics to advanced machine learning, from geospatial analysis to policy evaluation—culminated in a capstone project that seeks to identify sustainable pathways for hydropower development in a net-zero future. Through this closeread document, I invite you to explore the knowledge, skills, and insights I’ve gained across thirteen core courses and a transformative capstone experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MEDS program is designed as an intensive, one-year professional degree that bridges environmental science with data science. As a student, I was immersed in a collaborative environment supported by expert faculty from the Bren School and the National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis (NCEAS). The program’s philosophy centers on using data science to advance solutions to environmental problems—a mission that resonated deeply with my own goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MEDS curriculum is organized into four quarters, each building upon the previous:\n\nSummer Session B: Foundational skills in mathematics, workflows, Python, and scientific programming\nFall Quarter: Working with environmental datasets, statistics, geospatial analysis, and ethics\nWinter Quarter: Modeling environmental systems, data visualization, policy evaluation, and capstone initiation\nSpring Quarter: Databases, machine learning, and capstone completion\n\nEach course was designed not just to teach technical skills, but to foster a deep understanding of how data science can be responsibly applied to environmental challenges."
