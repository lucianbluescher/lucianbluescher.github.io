# Introduction: A Year of Transformation

{#cr-intro}
When I began the Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program at UC Santa Barbara's Bren School, I knew I was stepping into a world where environmental science meets cutting-edge computational methods. What I didn't fully anticipate was how profoundly this one-year intensive program would reshape my understanding of data, science, and the complex environmental challenges facing our planet.

This journey—from foundational mathematics to advanced machine learning, from geospatial analysis to policy evaluation—culminated in a capstone project that seeks to identify sustainable pathways for hydropower development in a net-zero future. Through this closeread document, I invite you to explore the knowledge, skills, and insights I've gained across thirteen core courses and a transformative capstone experience.

<!-- ![PLACEHOLDER: Photo of Bren School or UCSB campus - wide landscape shot showing the beautiful coastal setting where MEDS takes place](images/meds-campus.jpg) -->

The MEDS program is designed as an intensive, one-year professional degree that bridges environmental science with data science. As a student, I was immersed in a collaborative environment supported by expert faculty from the Bren School and the National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis (NCEAS). The program's philosophy centers on using data science to advance solutions to environmental problems—a mission that resonated deeply with my own goals.
:::
:::

## The Program Structure

The MEDS curriculum is organized into four quarters, each building upon the previous:

- **Summer Session B**: Foundational skills in mathematics, workflows, Python, and scientific programming
- **Fall Quarter**: Working with environmental datasets, statistics, geospatial analysis, and ethics
- **Winter Quarter**: Modeling environmental systems, data visualization, policy evaluation, and capstone initiation
- **Spring Quarter**: Databases, machine learning, and capstone completion

Each course was designed not just to teach technical skills, but to foster a deep understanding of how data science can be responsibly applied to environmental challenges.

# Summer Session B: Building Foundations

{#cr-summer}
The summer session was an intensive introduction to the tools and thinking that would underpin everything to come. Four courses in rapid succession: Essential Math, Analytical Workflows, Python Programming, and Scientific Programming Essentials.

:::{.cr-section}
## EDS 212: Essential Math for Environmental Data Science

*Instructor: Carmen Galaz García*

Mathematics is the language of data science. This course refreshed fundamental skills in algebra, calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, and logical operations—all essential for understanding the models and methods we would use throughout the program.

<!-- ![PLACEHOLDER: Mathematical visualization showing calculus concepts or distribution functions](images/eds212-math.jpg) -->

**Key Concepts:**
- Multivariate functions and their applications
- Derivative and integral calculus for environmental modeling
- Differential equations for dynamic systems

- Image resolutions: spatial, temporal, spectral, radiometric
- Land cover classification (supervised and unsupervised)

The course taught me that spatial data requires special consideration—spatial autocorrelation, coordinate systems, and scale all matter profoundly for analysis and interpretation.
:::

:::{.cr-section}
## EDS 242: Ethics and Bias in Environmental Data Science

*Instructor: Jayajit Chakraborty*

Data science isn't neutral. This course examined ethical considerations in collecting, using, and reporting environmental data, and how to recognize and account for biases.

<!-- ![PLACEHOLDER: Infographic or visualization showing types of data bias and their impacts](images/eds242-ethics.jpg) -->

**Types of Data Bias:**
1. **Confirmation Bias**: Seeing what you want to see
2. **Historical Bias**: Deceived by context of data creators
3. **Selection Bias**: Non-representative samples (coverage, non-response, sampling, recall)
4. **Survivorship Bias**: Including only surviving data points
5. **Availability Bias**: Recording data by ease of access
6. **Reporting Bias**: Dataset frequency doesn't reflect real-world frequency
7. **Observer Bias**: Subjectivity of the observer
8. **Geographic Data Bias**: Where data comes from matters
9. **Urban vs. Rural Bias**: Spatial representation disparities

The course emphasized that recognizing bias isn't enough—we must actively work to mitigate it and be transparent about limitations in our data and methods. Ethical data science requires constant vigilance and critical reflection.
:::

:::{.cr-section}
## EDS 230: Modeling Environmental Systems

*Instructor: Christina Tague*

Models are simplifications of reality designed to answer questions. This course covered both selecting and applying existing models and designing new ones.

<!-- ![PLACEHOLDER: Conceptual model diagram showing inputs, processes, and outputs of an environmental system](images/eds230-models.jpg) -->

**Model Types:**
- **Stochastic vs. Deterministic**: Probability-based vs. fixed outcomes
- **Lumped vs. Spatially Distributed**: Single point vs. spatial variation

- **Abstract vs. Physically Based**: Data-driven (ML) vs. mechanism-based

**Key Concepts:**
- Conceptual models: diagrams of system relationships
- Sensitivity analysis: understanding parameter uncertainty
- Dynamic models: differential equations and state space trajectories
- Feedback loops: positive (runaway growth) and negative (dampening)
- Stability: stable, unstable, and chaotic systems

The course emphasized that "all models are wrong, but some are useful." The goal isn't perfect representation—it's useful simplification that helps answer specific questions.
:::

:::{.cr-section}
## EDS 240: Data Visualization and Communication

*Instructors: Samantha Shanny-Csik, Annie Adams*

Effective communication is central to data science. This course focused on creating responsible, accessible, and visually compelling visualizations.

# The Capstone: Hydropower's Low-Hanging Fruits

{#cr-capstone}
My capstone project, conducted with teammates Leela Dixit, Sofia Sarak, and Vedika Shirtekar, represents the integration of everything I learned in MEDS. In collaboration with Dr. Jeff Opperman (WWF Global Science) and Dr. Rafael Schmitt (UCSB), we developed a framework to identify sustainable pathways for hydropower development.

:::{.cr-section}
## The Environmental Challenge

<!-- ![PLACEHOLDER: Global map showing river fragmentation or hydropower dam locations](images/capstone-challenge.jpg) -->

Hydropower presents a fundamental dilemma: it's a low-carbon, flexible energy source that can support climate action, but dams fragment rivers, disrupt ecosystems, and impact communities. Current projections suggest we may need to double global hydropower capacity by 2050 to meet climate objectives, but 63% of the world's longest rivers are already fragmented.

**The Core Question:**
Can we identify "low-hanging fruits"—future dam sites that combine lower environmental impact with energy system benefits—to reconcile climate goals with river conservation?

This question isn't just academic. It's urgent. As Dr. Opperman wrote in his letter of support: "Current high-level policy debates about hydropower's role in addressing future climate and energy challenges are not adequately considering the potential tradeoffs with hydropower expansion."
:::

:::{.cr-section}
## Project Objectives

Our project aimed to analyze sustainability constraints for expanding future hydropower by:

1. **Identifying topological relationships**: Determining where future dams sit relative to existing dams (upstream, downstream, within cascades, or blocking free-flowing rivers)

2. **Screening for conflicts**: Identifying "fatal flaws" such as conflicts with protected areas or population centers

3. **Categorizing sustainability**: Classifying at least 3,700 global dam sites into sustainability categories

4. **Quantifying capacity**: Calculating generation capacity (in gigawatts) within each category

<!-- ![PLACEHOLDER: Schematic diagram showing the four sustainability categories (SI Figure 1 from proposal)](images/capstone-categories.jpg) -->

The goal was to enable investors and policymakers to judge the environmental impact associated with different levels of hydropower expansion, closing a critical knowledge gap in energy systems planning.
:::

:::{.cr-section}
## The Data Science Approach

<!-- ![PLACEHOLDER: Workflow diagram showing the analytical pipeline from raw data to final outputs](images/capstone-workflow.jpg) -->

**Key Datasets:**
1. **HydroRivers**: Global vectorized river network with metadata (discharge, etc.)
2. **GRAND**: Global Reservoir and Dam dataset (7,300 existing large dams)
3. **FHReD**: Future Hydropower and Reservoir Data (~3,700 future dam sites)
4. **Protected Planet**: Protected area boundaries for conflict screening
5. **WorldPop**: Population density data for conflict screening

**Analytical Tools:**
- **sf package**: Vector data and geospatial operations
- **tidygraph package**: Network topology and connectivity analysis
- **riverconn package**: River fragmentation indices
- **Shiny package**: Interactive web applications

All datasets are vectorized and publicly available, enabling reproducible analysis on personal computers by processing one river basin at a time.
:::

:::{.cr-section}
## Deliverables

### Deliverable 1: Scripted Workflow

A reproducible workflow to:
- Identify topological location of future dams relative to existing dams
- Screen for conflicts ("fatal flaws") with protected areas and population centers
- Enable future expansion with additional data and screening criteria

<!-- ![PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of workflow code or GitHub repository structure](images/capstone-d1.jpg) -->

### Deliverable 2: Updated Dataset

An enhanced dataset of future dams with:
- Sustainability category classification (within cascade, upstream/downstream, undammed river, or fatally flawed)
- Increase in river fragmentation index for each future dam
- Generation capacity by category

<!-- ![PLACEHOLDER: Data visualization showing dam categorization results or capacity by category](images/capstone-d2.jpg) -->

### Deliverable 3: Interactive Web Viewer

A Shiny application enabling users to:
- Visualize results spatially
- Filter and analyze by country, capacity range, or sustainability category
- Explore dam locations and their impacts

<!-- ![PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of Shiny app interface showing interactive map and filters](images/capstone-d3.jpg) -->
:::

:::{.cr-section}
## The Research Context

Our work builds on important prior research:

**Schmitt & Rosa (2024)** found that:
- Global demand for hydropower (+38%) and irrigation storage (+73%) by 2050
- Europe and South Asia face "double deficits" where neither energy nor water needs can be met by dams alone
- 43% of current hydropower relies on multipurpose dams, creating conflicts
- 60-64% of remaining technical potential needed just to meet basic projections

**Grill et al. (2019)** mapped the world's free-flowing rivers, showing that:
- Only 1/3 of major rivers remain free-flowing
- Current dam building would fragment many remaining free-flowing rivers
- Large tropical rivers supporting productive fisheries and deltas are particularly at risk

**Schmitt et al. (2019)** on the Mekong:
- Strategic dam placement can achieve same energy with 4% sediment loss vs. 79% under business-as-usual
- The 3S Basin (10% of land area) provides 25% of sediment—losing it is catastrophic
- Vietnam gets 0% of new hydropower but bears 100% of geomorphic costs

<!-- ![PLACEHOLDER: Map of Mekong River Basin showing dam locations and sediment flow](images/capstone-mekong.jpg) -->
:::

:::{.cr-section}
## Key Insights and Broader Impact

<!-- ![PLACEHOLDER: Final results visualization showing global patterns of sustainable vs. high-impact dam sites](images/capstone-results.jpg) -->

**What Our Analysis Reveals:**

1. **Spatial Patterns**: Some regions (Latin America, South Asia) have hydropower surplus relative to decarbonization needs, while others face deficits, especially where sites are in ecologically sensitive or populated areas.

2. **Cascade Benefits**: Dams built within existing cascades have much lower impacts than new dams on free-flowing rivers—this is the "low-hanging fruit."

3. **Conflict Identification**: Many proposed sites conflict with protected areas or population centers—these "fatal flaws" should be avoided.

4. **Capacity by Category**: Understanding how much capacity exists in each sustainability category enables energy system planners to make informed decisions.

**Broader Impact:**

Our methods contribute to:
- **Policy Dialogues**: Enabling global and national policy discussions based on quantitative data
- **Energy Systems Modeling**: Straightforward integration of sustainability criteria into energy planning
- **Accessibility**: Allowing local NGOs and citizens without resources to engage in science-informed debates
- **Avoiding Detrimental Effects**: Helping minimize negative impacts on rivers and communities

The workflow is designed to be adaptable, allowing for public expansion with additional indicators and downscaling to inform local decisions.
:::

:::{.cr-section}
## Technical Challenges and Solutions

<!-- ![PLACEHOLDER: Code snippet or technical diagram showing network analysis approach](images/capstone-technical.jpg) -->

**Challenge 1: Network Topology**
Understanding spatial relationships between dams in river networks required network analysis. We used `tidygraph` and `sfnetworks` to model river connectivity and identify cascade relationships.

**Challenge 2: Scale**
Processing global datasets with millions of river reaches required careful spatial subsetting and processing by basin. We developed workflows that could run on personal computers by processing one basin at a time.

**Challenge 3: Reproducibility**
Creating a workflow that others could use and modify required extensive documentation, modular code design, and clear data dependencies. We followed best practices from EDS 214 (workflows) throughout.

**Challenge 4: Visualization**
Communicating complex spatial and categorical information required thoughtful design. We used principles from EDS 240 (visualization) to create clear, accessible visualizations in our Shiny app.
:::

:::{.cr-section}
## Reflection: What I Learned

<!-- ![PLACEHOLDER: Personal reflection photo or team working together](images/capstone-reflection.jpg) -->

The capstone project was the most challenging and rewarding experience of the MEDS program. It required:

- **Integration**: Bringing together skills from every course—statistics, geospatial analysis, modeling, visualization, ethics, and more

- **Collaboration**: Working effectively with teammates, clients, and advisors, following the "Ten Simple Rules" for collaborative data science

- **Problem-Solving**: Tackling real-world challenges with no clear answers, requiring creativity and persistence

- **Communication**: Translating technical work for diverse audiences—scientists, policymakers, and the public

- **Responsibility**: Working on a project with real-world implications, requiring careful consideration of ethics and impacts

The capstone wasn't just about applying what I learned—it was about learning how to learn, how to adapt, and how to contribute meaningfully to environmental problem-solving.
