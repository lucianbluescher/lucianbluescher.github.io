But not all ocean waters are created equal. Marine species have specific environmental requirements, and identifying optimal farming locations requires careful spatial analysis of oceanographic conditions.\n\n**This analysis addresses a key question: Which U.S. West Coast Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) offers the most suitable habitat for commercially important shellfish species?**\n\nBy combining sea surface temperature data, ocean depth measurements, and EEZ boundaries, we can pinpoint the regions where aquaculture operations would have the greatest chance of success.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nAquaculture is the fastest-growing food production sector globally, now accounting for over half of all fish consumed worldwide (FAO, 2022). Along the U.S. West Coast, shellfish farming represents a sustainable industry that provides economic benefits to coastal communities while offering ecosystem services like water filtration and habitat creation.\n\nHowever, the success of aquaculture operations depends heavily on site selection. Species like oysters and abalone have narrow tolerance ranges for temperature and depth. Farming outside these optimal conditions leads to increased mortality, slower growth rates, and economic losses. Climate change further complicates this picture, as shifting ocean temperatures may alter which regions remain viable for specific species (Froehlich et al., 2018).\n\nUnderstanding current habitat suitability is therefore essential for:\n\n-   **Industry planning**: Guiding investment decisions for aquaculture operations\n-   **Regulatory management**: Informing marine spatial planning within EEZs\n-   **Climate adaptation**: Establishing baselines to track future habitat shifts\n\n## Data Sources\n\nThis analysis integrates three primary datasets:\n\n| Dataset | Source | Description |\n|----|----|----|\n| **Sea Surface Temperature** | NOAA | Average annual SST rasters (2008-2012) |\n| **Bathymetry** | General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) | Ocean depth measurements |\n| **Exclusive Economic Zones** | Marine Regions | West Coast EEZ boundary polygons |\n\nSpecies-specific temperature and depth requirements were obtained from [SeaLifeBase](https://www.sealifebase.ca/search.php), a global database of marine life information.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## The Approach: Habitat Suitability Modeling\n\nThe analysis follows a systematic workflow to identify suitable aquaculture locations:\n\n1.  **Define species requirements**: Establish acceptable ranges for sea surface temperature (°C) and depth (m)\n2.  **Reclassify environmental layers**: Convert continuous SST and depth data into binary suitability maps (1 = suitable, 0 = unsuitable)\n3.  **Overlay analysis**: Combine layers to identify areas meeting *all* criteria\n4.  **Zonal statistics**: Calculate total suitable area within each EEZ region\n5.  **Visualization**: Map results to compare regional suitability\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Case Study 1: Oysters (General)\n\nOysters (*Crassostrea* spp.) are among the most economically important aquaculture species on the West Coast. They thrive in waters with temperatures between **11–30°C** and depths from the surface down to **70 meters**.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmap_species_suitability(\"Oysters\", sst_min = 11, sst_max = 30, \n                        depth_min = -70, depth_max = 0)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Habitat suitability for oyster aquaculture across West Coast EEZs. Central California emerges as the region with the greatest suitable area.](index_files/figure-html/fig-oysters-1.png){#fig-oysters width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Key Finding**: Central California offers the most extensive suitable habitat for general oyster farming, with its combination of moderate temperatures and extensive shallow coastal waters.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Case Study 2: Olympia Oysters (*Ostrea lurida*)\n\nThe Olympia oyster is the only oyster species native to the West Coast and has significant ecological and cultural value. However, it has much narrower temperature requirements (**10–12°C**) compared to other oyster species.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmap_species_suitability(\"Olympia Oysters\", sst_min = 10, sst_max = 12, \n                        depth_min = -71, depth_max = 0)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Habitat suitability for Olympia oyster aquaculture. Washington's cooler waters provide the most suitable conditions for this native species.](index_files/figure-html/fig-olympia-1.png){#fig-olympia width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Key Finding**: Washington emerges as the optimal region for Olympia oyster restoration and aquaculture efforts, reflecting the species' preference for cooler northern waters.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Case Study 3: Red Abalone (*Haliotis rufescens*)\n\nRed abalone are prized for their meat and shells but have experienced dramatic population declines due to overharvesting and disease. They prefer temperatures between **8–18°C** and shallower depths (down to **24 meters**).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmap_species_suitability(\"Red Abalone\", sst_min = 8, sst_max = 18, \n                        depth_min = -24, depth_max = 0)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Habitat suitability for red abalone aquaculture. Washington provides the largest area of suitable habitat based on temperature and depth requirements.](index_files/figure-html/fig-abalone-1.png){#fig-abalone width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Key Finding**: Washington's cooler waters and suitable bathymetry make it the most promising region for red abalone aquaculture development.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThis analysis reveals distinct spatial patterns in aquaculture suitability across the West Coast:\n\n| Species           | Optimal EEZ        | Temperature Range | Depth Range |\n|-------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------|\n| Oysters (general) | Central California | 11–30°C           | 0–70m       |\n| Olympia Oyster    | Washington         | 10–12°C           | 0–71m       |\n| Red Abalone       | Washington         | 8–18°C            | 0–24m       |\n\n**Washington's cooler waters make it particularly valuable for temperature-sensitive species**, while Central California's warmer and more extensive shallow areas favor species with broader thermal tolerance.\n\n### Limitations & Future Directions\n\nThis analysis provides a useful first approximation, but several factors warrant consideration:\n\n-   **Temporal variability**: SST data represents a 5-year average (2008–2012); seasonal and interannual variability could affect site-specific suitability\n-   **Additional parameters**: Factors like salinity, chlorophyll concentration, current patterns, and substrate type also influence aquaculture success\n-   **Climate projections**: Future analyses should incorporate climate model projections to assess long-term viability\n-   **Regulatory constraints**: Not all suitable areas may be available for aquaculture due to existing uses or protected status\n\nDespite these limitations, spatial habitat suitability modeling provides an essential foundation for sustainable aquaculture development along the West Coast.\n\n## References\n\nFAO.
